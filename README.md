## Introduction
This a secure client server application: the messages exchanged are signed and encrypted using the OpenSSL library.

The multi threaded server can handle multiple clients connected at the same time.

For every new connection the server creates a new thread which will comunicate with its associated client.

After a preliminar authentication phase whith the incoming clients, the server main thread forwards the messages received from the sending client to the destination client.

The client is multi threaded too in order to receive messages while sending them.

### Opcodes:
These are the opcodes that help identifing the messages different structure.
OPCODE# | Name | Meaning 
---  | --- | ---
0 | QUIT | the user exits the application
1 | LIST | the user requests the list of the updated online users
2 | RTT | the user requests to talk with the user specified in the payload
3 | ACCEPT | the user receives an RTT and accept it
4 | REFUSE | the user refuses to talk with the user who sent the RTT
5 | MESSAGE | the messages with this opcode are the messages exchanged during the chat

## Run it
To run this project:

- Open a terminal and run the server.
```sh
g++ -o server server.cpp -lcrypto -pthread
./server 10000
```

- Open more terminals and run the clients. 
```sh
g++ -o client client.cpp -lcrypto -pthread
./client localhost 10000 alice
```
